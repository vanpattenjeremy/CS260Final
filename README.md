# CS260Final

This project is a Pokemon team builder for the Pokemon games.

Each team consists of 6 pokemon. Users may search for pokemon by entering their name into the search box and clicking the "Add to Team" button. Pictures of each member of the team are shown along with the names and types of the pokemon below each picture. At the bottom, a type chart shows the type strengths and weaknesses of the team.

If a pokemon is missing from the database, the user may add the Pokemon to the database through the "Add Pokemon" page on the site. On this page the user is prompted to enter the name, type, and a link to the picture of the pokemon. If one of these fields are missing, it will prompt the user to enter the missing information. The user may then return to the main page and the pokemon will be usable for teams.
